# Learning React & API calls with Pokemon!

This project was created using pokeapi.co. I do not own any of the assets or the api everything was provided with liscences in place to protect intellectual properties. this project is to be used for education purposes only.

## Pagination Became Dynamic calls

This project started out paging through pokemon boringly with pagination which gave me the groundwork for what was to come. I then made the list of pokemon not pages but all of the pokemon of the type you selected. then to put a cherry on top once the pokemon info was done I added buttons to search the pokemon by the type of pokemon you were inspecting currently. this created an opprotunity to learn about react functions and dynamic flow throughout a react project
